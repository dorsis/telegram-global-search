# telegram-global-search

A method of bypassing Telegram's search limitations to obtain all relevant search results for a given query.

Currently, telegram is designed so that each query yields up to 10 very specific results, but these results are in no way comprehensive of all relevant results. With the script, you can bypass these limitations and see the full list of relevant groups and channels.
